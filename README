UTILITIES FOR X/MWM
===================

XMSM
----------
xmsm is simple session manager that provides session configuration and screen
locking and also launches the window manager and the toolbox.

A startup shell script called xmsession is provided for convenience. It
redirects program ouput to ~/.xmsession.log, execs ~/.Xprofile and merges
user's X resource databases prior to launching xmsm.

XMTOOLBOX
---------
xmtoolbox is an application launcher/menu configured with a simple text file.
It also communicates with the session manager to provide lock, log out, and
shutdown commands.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================

X11 and Motif libraries and headers are required to build all utilities.

The default installation prefix is /usr/local, but may be changed by
editing the Makefile (find the line reading PREFIX=/usr/local and change it
according to your preferences).

Run make to build, then run 'make install' as root.

The session manager 'xmsm' is installed suid root, this is required for screen
locking functionality, but root privileges are dropped at startup and are only
reaquired for a short period of time during password check.
