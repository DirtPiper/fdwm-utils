UTILITIES FOR EMWM
==================

XMSM
----------
xmsm is simple session manager that provides session configuration and screen
locking and also launches the window manager and the toolbox.

A startup shell script called xmsession is provided for convenience. It
redirects program output to ~/.xmsession.log, execs ~/.Xprofile and merges
user's X resource databases prior to launching xmsm.

XMTOOLBOX
---------
xmtoolbox is an application launcher/menu configured with a simple text file.
It also communicates with the session manager to provide lock, log out, and
shutdown commands.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================
X11 and Motif libraries and headers are required to build all utilities.

Make sure to review the Makefile and adjust PREFIX, MANDIR and RESDIR variables
to file system locations appropriate for your system.

Run make to build, then run 'make install' as root.

NOTES
---------
System shutdown, reboot and suspend commands can be altered at compile time
only. Edit constants in smconf.h if necessary.

Xmtoolbox requires either ~/.toolboxrc or /etc/X11/toolboxrc to be present.
There is a sample toolboxrc file in the source directory, which may be used as
a starting point. More info in xmtoolbox(1).

The session manager 'xmsm' is installed suid root, this is required for screen
locking functionality, but root privileges are dropped at startup and are only
reacquired for short periods of time when necessary.
