UTILITIES FOR EMWM
==================

XMSM
----------
xmsm is simple session manager that provides session configuration and screen
locking and also launches the window manager and the toolbox.

A startup shell script called xmsession is provided for convenience. It
redirects program ouput to ~/.xmsession.log, execs ~/.Xprofile and merges
user's X resource databases prior to launching xmsm.

XMTOOLBOX
---------
xmtoolbox is an application launcher/menu configured with a simple text file.
It also communicates with the session manager to provide lock, log out, and
shutdown commands.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================

X11 and Motif libraries and headers are required to build all utilities.

The default installation prefix is /usr, which may be changed by modifying
PREFIX, MANDIR and RESDIR variables in the Makefile.

Run make to build, then run 'make install' as root.

NOTES
-----

The session manager 'xmsm' is installed suid root, this is required for screen
locking functionality, but root privileges are dropped at startup and are only
reaquired for a short period of time during password check.

Xmtoolbox requires either ~/.toolboxrc or /etc/X11/toolboxrc to be present.
There is a sample toolboxrc file in the source directory, which may be used as
a starting point. More info in xmtoolbox(1).
